# Inductive Bias in Deep Probabilistic Modelling
This repository contains the slides of my PhD defense. The slides are made with markdown and then interpreted on the fly a javascript markdown to html renderer (see for instance [https://github.com/glouppe/talk-kit](https://github.com/glouppe/talk-kit)). The folder `animations` contains the scripts I wrote to generate animations to explain normalizing flows with the great [Manim library](https://www.manim.community). 

You can also find the repository for my thesis [here](https://github.com/AWehenkel/phd-thesis), or [a direct link to the pdf](https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/294546).

If any of these resources is useful to your work, you can cite the thesis as:
